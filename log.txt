| Okay, here's a 2-day Tokyo food itinerary designed for a serious culinary adventurer.  It's packed, but that's Tokyo!  I'll focus on a mix of high-end experiences, local favorites, and unique food adventures, with a balance of traditional and modern.  I'll also include travel tips to make it all flow smoothly.

**Important Considerations Before We Begin:**

*   **Reservations:**  For many of the high-end places (especially sushi and tempura), reservations are *essential*, often weeks or even months in advance.  I'll note where this is crucial.  Use a service like TableCheck or Pocket Concierge, or ask your hotel concierge for help |
